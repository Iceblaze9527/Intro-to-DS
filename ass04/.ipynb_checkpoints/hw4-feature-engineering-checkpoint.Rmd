## 0. Basic knowledge of feature engineering

```{python}
## Question 1: A good feature should be __________ and __________.
```

```{python}
## Question 2: Why is image feature extraction hard? __________________________________________________
```

```{python}
## Question 3: As we have learned in class, both 'Maximum entropy' and 'Smallest margin' can be used to
##             measure uncertainty in active learning. Please explain which one is better for active learning and why?
##             Note that: this is an open question and you can answer in Chinese as well.

## 1. Text feature engineering

```{python}
## Given a corpus as:
corpus = ['The goal of this lecture is to explain text processing.',
          'The bag of words model is one such approach.',
          'Text processing via bag of words.',
          'Data science includes text processing']
```

```{python}
# !pip3 install sklearn
## Question 4: Use BOW to extract features of the given corpus. 
## 
## Your code here
## 
```

```{python}
## Question 5: Use TFIDF to extract features of the given corpus. 
## 
## Your code here
## 
```

```{python}
## Question 6: Use Word2Vec to extract features of the given corpus. 
# !pip3 install gensim
from gensim.test.utils import common_texts
from gensim.sklearn_api import W2VTransformer
# Create a model to represent each word by a 10 dimensional vector
model = W2VTransformer(size=10, min_count=1, seed=1)
## The model trained on the common_texts
# What is the vector representation of the word ‘graph’? 
common_texts
wordvecs = model.fit(common_texts).transform(['graph']) 
wordvecs
## 
## You should extract the vector representation of the word 'text' by the model trained on the given corpus.
## Note that: the formulation of the given corpus is different from that of common_texts, 
## you should transform the given corpus to the the formulation of common_texts first.
## 
## Your code here
## 
```

## 2. Time series feature engineering

```{python}
## Question 7: Use decompose (model='additive') to extract time series features of the given time series
from random import randrange
import math
from pandas import Series
series = Series([20*math.sin(i/18*math.pi) + i + randrange(10) for i in range(1,360)])
```

```{python}
from matplotlib import pyplot
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose
## 
## Your code here
## 
```

```{python}
## Question 8: Use Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to extract time series features of the given time series
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
series = Series([np.cos(2*math.pi*1/8*n+math.pi/8) for n in range(800)])
## 
## Your code here
## 
```

## 3. Image feature engineering

```{python}
## Use SIFT in opencv-python to extract image features on the given image 'morning.jpg'
# !pip install opencv-python==3.4.2.16
# !pip install opencv-contrib-python==3.4.2.16
## Note that: NOT all versions of opencv-contrib-python includes SIFT in cv2.xfeatures2d, 
## but this specified version does
import cv2
import numpy as np
name = 'dog.jpg'
img = cv2.imread(name)
gray_img= cv2.cvtColor(img,cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
print("The shape of the image: ", gray_img.shape)
siftDetector= cv2.xfeatures2d.SIFT_create()
## Note that: SIFT was re-organized in opencv thus you should import it like this.

## finds the keypoint in the images
kp = siftDetector.detect(gray_img,None)
## draws the small circles on the locations of keypoints
cv2.drawKeypoints(gray_img,kp,img,flags=cv2.DRAW_MATCHES_FLAGS_DRAW_RICH_KEYPOINTS)
cv2.imwrite('sift_keypoint_' + name, img) ## Save Example
## directly find keypoints and descriptors in a single step 
kp, des = siftDetector.detectAndCompute(gray_img,None)
print("The shape of feature description: ", des.shape)
```

```{python}
## Question 9: Please rescale the given image 'dog.jpg' at a random ratio between 0.3 with 1.5.
##          Note that: the width and height of the given image should be rescaled at a different ratio.
##          Repeat this operation five times, then you will get five new images with different scale.
##
##          Please extract the SIFT features of these images respectively and use 'imwrite' to save them.
##          An example of saving keypoints on the input image is shown as follow:
##          cv2.drawKeypoints(gray_img,kp,img,flags=cv2.DRAW_MATCHES_FLAGS_DRAW_RICH_KEYPOINTS)
##          cv2.imwrite('sift_keypoint_' + name, img)
##
## 
## Your code here
## 
```

```{python}
## Question 10: Please rotate the given image 'dog.jpg' 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 degrees clockwise,
##              then you will get six new images with different rotation angle.
##              Please extract the SIFT features of these images respectively and use 'imwrite' to save them.
##              An example of saving keypoints on the input image is shown as follow:
##              cv2.drawKeypoints(gray_img,kp,img,flags=cv2.DRAW_MATCHES_FLAGS_DRAW_RICH_KEYPOINTS)
##              cv2.imwrite('sift_keypoint_' + name, img)
```

```{python}

```
